It was created to serve as a place to scribble down notes, think out loud and reflect on stuff. That stuff will mostly be coding but might also concern other subjects.

What about subjects? Probably programming, food and product/team/self management.

<!-- ```javascript
// comments are neat
const variable = ['one', 'two']

variable.map((v) => {
	return v
});
