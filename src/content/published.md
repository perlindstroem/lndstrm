Just before Christmas I got an early present! In 2019 I finished university and wrote a master's thesis on predicting movement trajectories in soccer. It had an okay outcome. I am not sure if I contributed that much to the field (one of the goals of the thesis). I had a really engaged examiner who believed in me and my work. 

After the thesis we co-wrote a research article with another professor and my supervisor at the company where I wrote the thesis ([Signality](https://signality.com)). The writing itself took some time but was not too hard and we were accepted to present at MLSA19 at ECML.

The presentation however was super scary and nerve-wrecking, but also a really educational experience.
